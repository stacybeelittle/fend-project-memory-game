## Overview

A simple and interactive card matching game with a move counter and star rating.
Click a card to start the timer and try to find all the matches.

## How To Play

- click any card to flip it over
- click on a second card, and if the icons match, they turn green and you're on your way to winning.  If the icons do NOT match, the cards will flip themselves back over.  Try to remember what their icons were to match with other cards!
- keep turning over cards to find matches.  The less moves it takes you to find all the matches, the more stars you earn!
- when all matches have been found, a pop-up will appear to show you your final score and number of stars earned.  
- use the reset button at any time to start a new game!
